# Linkits

Keep the links you like on the web under one roof. Share them with others when they need.

## Problem and solution

### The problem

Current bookmarking is fragmented:

- Bookmarks saved on PC browser aren't accessible on phone or other devices
- Can't share collections of links easily - only individual links
- Valuable resource lists shared on social media get lost in feeds
- No organized way to group related links by topic/project

This painpoint is personal, not yet validated with others.
The goal at this stage it to validate and then iterate.

Project goal: Launch it and get users who will also want to get users (for their collections), to test traction of the concept

### Existing solutions tried

Notion: Too complicated for this simple use case. 
It also lacks:

- SEO analytics
- Visibility analytics

These analytics features are crucial requirements for the system.

Specific analytics needed:

- View count per collection
- Click tracking on individual links within collections
- Traffic source tracking (referrers - where visitors are coming from)

SEO optimization so public collections rank in search engines and can be discovered organically

### The solution

An online platform for collecting and organizing links into shareable collections.

Core flow:

- User finds interesting content online
- Saves it to a collection on the platform (instead of browser bookmark)
- Can access from any device
- Can share entire collection via link
- Key feature: Collections can have multiple sections

Example: "Travel content in Africa" collection

Section: West Africa → creators A, B, C
Section: South Africa → creators X, Y, Z

Use cases
- Job search platforms in tech
- Free stock photo sites (Pixabay, Pexels, Lummi)
- Team resources (testing environments, production links, repos)
- Educational content (YouTube tutorials on coding, marketing, SEO, AI)
- Portfolio/work history (projects worked on at Company X)
- Content creators by niche (travel creators focusing on Africa)
