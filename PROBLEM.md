**The problem**: As I am always browsing the web, I discovered a lot of things, research papers, Youtube channels, podcasts,  tools or projects on Github that I wanted to return back to. And for that of course, I can just bookmark them in my browser to quickly reach them if I want. but I can't access them on my phone if I bookmarked them on my pc, or my desktop. Plus, I can share the links individually, but I couldn't share the links collectively. And, I've seen many times someone sharing resources on "websites to find gigs online" or "10 typefaces that can improve the visual of your website" but these links get lost in the feed of whatever social media they shared it on. These are just two examples but it applies to many products. 

What if there was a platform than can essentially serve as an "online" bookmark for those content ?
Here is how I see things:
- I search online platforms that can help me land a job in tech. I find one, it looks interesting and I would like to come back to it. Instead of bookmarking it on the browser, I collect it on the platform.
- I find another link, I store it in the same place I saved the first one.

When I want people to know they can just use these platforms, I just share the collection's link with them.

- Platforms where I can find amazing pictures (ai-generated or not) that I can use in my projects: I collect pixabay, pexels, lummi and so forth. I will just share them when someone asks.

- I am in a team, we are working on a tech product. we have two or multiple environments, where the preview/testing environment replicates what's in production. Plus, we also have 2 or more repo. These are ressources; I save them into ONE collection.

- I watched tutorials about coding, growth marketing, sales, seo, ai, or more. These can be really life-saving for someone who is getting started in those fields. I saved the channels into one collection so that I can just jump back to those ressources later (or share them  or course)

- I worked on multiple projects in company X. And I know I will have a hard time remembering exactly on what did I work, when I leave. As they are tech products, I just store them on a collection.

- I've seen a lot of travel content targeting africa from creators like Wodemaya, Steven Ndukwu, Tayo Aina... I grouped them so that someone else can quickly discover them when they are interested.

So the **solution** is to have a resource collector online, where I can just create a collection, and save the links in it.I also wanted these collections to have multiple topics so I made things in a way that in a collection there can be multiple sections. Example talking about travel content in Africa: 'West Africa' => x creators, 'South' => y creators... and all of them are sections of the same collection.
